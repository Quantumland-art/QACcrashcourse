In this tutorial, I will walk through most features of The QAC Toolkit, a free Max package (available on the package manager) that allows musicians and artists to build, run, and simulate quantum circuits inside Max. This tutorial will include a short introduction to the topic of quantum computing, different quantum gates, how to build quantum circuits and change them programmatically, and even how to run them on real quantum hardware. The tutorial ends with a brief overview of the online community.quantumland.art and how to continue to be involved in the development of the field of music with quantum computing.

## Requirements
- Latest [Max/msp](https://cycling74.com) installed
- [Ableton Live](https://ableton.com) 11 or higher
